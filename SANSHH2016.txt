This was the first Holiday Hack I participated in and I just want to thank yall for the experience. It was incredible.

Question 1:
After copying all the tweets to a text file then using regex to get ride of everything except the tweets reveals the ASCII art words of BUGBOUNTY.


Question 2:
The zip file which is found at the url http://northpolewonderland.com/SantaGram_v4.2.zip which is a combination of the url on the notebook as well as the attachment in the urlbar of the laptop contains the APK file SantaGram_4.2.apk


Question 3:
The username and the password were hardcoded into the SplashScreen.class file in com.northpolewonderland.santagram.
To get to the .class file I first ran dex2jar on the apk file to convert it into a jar file.
Then I used the tool jd-gui to look at the .class files in SantaGram.jar
After sifting through the files I found the following:
The Username is "guest"
The password is "busyreindeer78"


Question 4:
First I unpacked the APK file using the the apktool.
The audio file was located in the raw folder of the unpacked APK.
The name of the audio file is discombobulatedaudio1.mp3


Question 5:
The password for the "cranpi" is yummycookie. 
To get the password I extracted the shadow file from the cranbian.img
I then ran the shadow file through John the Ripper with the wordlist being rockyou.txt


Question 6:
*NOTE: Terminals are listed in the order in which I solved them*

	Wumpus Terminal (Santa's workshop):
	The process for finding the Wumpus is as followed.
	I ran through the cave once to get a feel for how the game was played.
	On the second run I try a graph of the rooms and all of their connecting tunnels.
	After mapping what rooms were adjacent to the Wumpus (smell) I could fire an arrow into the room and kill it.

	The corresponding password is:
	WUMPUS IS MISUNDERSTOOD

	Door to Santa's Office (Santa's workshop):
	Based off of the instruction I guessed that it may be a hidden directory. 
	I ran the following command:
	$find .

	What was returned was the tree structure of all of the directories that start with .

	The one that stood out was:
	/./.doormat/. / /\/\\/Don't Look Here!/You are persistent, aren't you?/'/key_for_the_door.txt

	I then ran the command cat with all of the special characters listed above escaped.
	The password that I got back was open_sesame


	War Games Terminal (Santa's Office):
	The prompt on the terminal was from War Games (movie).
	I responded exactly like it was in the movie.

	The computer gave me the password: LOOK AT THE PRETTY LIGHTS


	Elf House #2 Terminal:
	Running the command ls -la you see that the file that I need to access is owned by itchy.
	To see what commands I can run as itchy without needing their password I ran the command sudo -l

	It told me I could use strings and tcpdump as itchy.
	I ran strings on the out.pcap and discovered that the first half of the password is santasli.
	Based off of the theme of the game I guessed that the passphrase must be santaslittlehelper so the second half of the password is ttlehelper.


	Train Terminal:
	HELP uses less to open the file /home/conductor/TrainHelper.txt
	Less allows the user to execute commands using !{shell-command}

	I ran the command !ls which listed the files ActivateTrain, TrainHelper.txt and Train_Console in /home/conductor/
	After searching through Train_Console using the  followuing command:
	!cat Train_Console

	I discovered the password 24fb3e89ce2aa0ea422c3d511d40dd84 hardcoded into the code.
	This password is used to START the train.
	Release the break with BRAKEOFF and then START the train.
	I entered the password when prompted and then blasted off to the future.
